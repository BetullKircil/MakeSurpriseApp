### Surprise Gift Application:

The Surprise Gift App is a mobile platform that simplifies the gift selection and purchasing process, saves time, and makes the shopping experience fun. The app provides personalized gift recommendations based on the user‚Äôs budget and preferences. Users can complete a questionnaire about the person receiving the gift to find the best options.

The most exciting feature of the app is the surprise factor. The gift recipient will not know the gift in advance, creating a mysterious experience. This adds an element of excitement to the shopping process.

Additionally, users can receive reminders about upcoming special days, helping them plan their gift purchases. The app resolves decision-making issues, time-wasting, and budget planning challenges with smart suggestions and a user-friendly interface.

### Main Features:
- User Management: Account creation, profile updates, password changes.
- Address & Shipment Tracking: Manage addresses and track shipment statuses.
- Special Day Management: Users can add special days and get reminders for upcoming ones.
- Surveys: Users can participate in surveys.
- Notifications: Personalized notifications sent to users.
This project is developed using React Native and Expo and aims to provide a practical, fun, and surprise-filled shopping experience with an easy-to-use interface.
